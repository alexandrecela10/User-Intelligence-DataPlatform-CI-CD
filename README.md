# User-Intelligence
- What makes a user retained? Generating revenue for life? 
- I am telling here the story of the Worker Intelligence project, which I ideated and drove during my time at Indeed Flex, which is a marketplace bringing together hospitality venues and gig workers
- In doing so, I was able to save a lot of time to both analysts and managers on lower value requests, and enable faster and easier high ROI data analysis on User Life Time Value

## What does this project bring to the table? 
- Clear access to key user information and user experience intelligence, in seconds
- Platform to build, very easily, in seconds, inputs to outputs analysis, especially user app bhaviour and user life time value analysis. What makes a user to be retained? To be upsold?
- **And doing, so, extremely fast**

## What pain points it solved 
- Frustration from PMs waiting days for several data pulls
- Frustration from analysis spending days on 'simple' yet tedious and boring data pullss
- **Crucial time gain for more ROI driven analysis and product improvement recommendations**

## How was it done? 
- I saw that gap, especially in building fast interesting analysis on user retention, and iterating fast on this
- From 8+ different datasets to a central one using DBT and CI/CD

## SQL Code Extract
Additionally, the repository includes an extract of the SQL code used in the development of the Worker Intelligence Data Platform. This illustrates the level of SQL skills and technicity needed to achieve the product. For confidentiality reasons, below is an extract, however the code spans 30+ tables and 800+ lines
